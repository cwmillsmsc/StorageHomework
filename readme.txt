I fially got the jquerymobile applaud plugin working for my android device, 
I had to install the target version 8 dependencies so they would show up
in the change target window. The storage tutorial stuff works fine, but when I
tried to modify it to accept form data, something crashes, and it won't install
the package on the phone when the project is run.
